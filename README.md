## Work History
- 2nd JAN 2025 : Controller workout, Xboxcontroller - ESP32 
- 26th DEC 2024 : Gave up on using shield, will develop manually.
- 18th DEC 2024 : Hardware assembled, Firmware flashed, 통신 확인 완료

## ToDo
- connect with batteries

## H/W
### Electric parts
- Voltage : 11 ~ 12 V
- Current : 3500mAH
- 밧데리 바로 연결 못 한 이유 : 전류가 너무 세서

### communications

Note: 
> 1.The video is only an installation tutorial, 
   The control circuit board UNO in the video has not been written into the code, 
   Please write the UNO code first, and then install the smart car.

> 2.If you buy an ESP32 control system, it can't control the motor with the encoder,
   it can only control the motor without the encoder.

> 3.If you want to control a motor with an encoder, you can purchase a UNO control system
   or replace the ESP32 board with a UNO board.

> It is recommended to use 11.1V/12V lithium battery, For example, use 3pcs 18650 for adapter board.
the current can be appropriately larger, and 3500mAH is more durable.
